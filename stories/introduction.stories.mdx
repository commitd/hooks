This is a library of useful react hooks.

It aims to remove repetition and effort for our different react based projects.
These are all no dependency hooks.
They will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our use of react.

## Getting Started

```
yarn add @committed/hooks
```

Each hook can be imported from the package directly or the matching names folder e.g..

```typescript
import { useEventListener } form '@committed/hooks'
```

or

```typescript
import { useEventListener } form '@committed/hooks/useEventListener'
```

The later may help with tree-shaking depending on your setup.

## Inspiration

Hooks in this library have been inspired by:

- [useHooks(🐠)](https://usehooks.com/)
- [useHooks.ts](https://usehooks-typescript.com/)
- [a hooks](https://ahooks.js.org/)
- [Aaron Powell](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2019-09-23-recursive-settimeout-with-react-hooks/)
- [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)

## Others

We recommend the following hooks from other libraries:

- [useSWR from 'swr'](https://swr.vercel.app/) for simplify the logic of data fetching.
- [useDebounce from 'use-debounce'](https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce) for more fully featured debounce.
- [useImmer from 'use-immer'](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) for simple immutable `useState`
