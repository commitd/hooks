This is a library of useful react hooks.

It aims to remove repetition and effort for our different react based projects.
They will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our use of react.

## Getting Started

```
yarn add @committed/hooks
```

Each hook can be imported from the package directly or the matching names folder e.g..

```typescript
import { useEventListener } form '@committed/hooks'
```

or

```typescript
import { useEventListener } form '@committed/hooks/useEventListener'
```

The later may help with tree-shaking depending on your setup.
